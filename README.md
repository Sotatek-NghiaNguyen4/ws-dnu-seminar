# DnU Tech Seminar Series Repository

## Introduction 

Welcome to our DnU Tech Seminar Series Repository! This repository is an archive of all the presentation slides and source code shared during our weekly technology seminars. It's meant to be a comprehensive and easily accessible resource for everyone who's interested in the topics discussed during our sessions.

## Repository Structure 

The repository is organized as follows:

- `seminars/` directory: Contains the directories of individual seminars named as per the date and topic of the seminar, e.g., `2023-07-13-Artificial-Intelligence/`.
    - Each seminar directory contains the following:
        - `slides/` directory: Presentation slides, typically in .ppt or .pdf format.
        - `source-code/` directory: Any accompanying source code shared during the seminar, organized by language and/or framework.
        - `README.md`: Detailed notes and summary of the seminar.
- `README.md`: This file, a general introduction and guide to the repository.

## How To Use

If you're looking for materials from a specific seminar, navigate to the appropriate directory in the `seminars/` directory. The directory name should correspond to the date and topic of the seminar.
